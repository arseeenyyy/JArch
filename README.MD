# 🏗️ JArch — Java Architecture Generator

**JArch** is a service that automatically generates ready-to-run Java projects (monoliths or microservices) based on a predefined architecture.
It includes **cloud configuration storage** and **asynchronous generation task processing** via **RabbitMQ**, making the process scalable and reliable.

## 🚀 Who It's For

* 👨‍💻 **Java Developers** — to quickly start new projects without manual setup.
* 🧠 **Team Leads & Architects** — to standardize architecture across teams.
* 🚀 **Startups** — to speed up MVP creation.
* ⚙️ **DevOps Engineers** — to unify templates and CI/CD integration.

## 💡 Why Use JArch

| Goal                    | Benefit                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧩 **Automation**       | Generates project structure, dependencies (Maven/Gradle), `Dockerfile`, and base packages. |
| ⚡ **Development Speed** | Get a ready-to-run project skeleton in seconds or minutes.                                 |
| 🔁 **Reproducibility**  | Unified architecture templates and centralized cloud configuration storage.                |
| 📈 **Scalability**      | RabbitMQ-based queues for asynchronous, fault-tolerant generation.                         |

## 🧱 Key Features

* Support for **monolithic** and **microservice** architectures.
* Configuration of **build systems** (Maven / Gradle).
* Generation of **base directory structures** and **initialization classes**.
* **Integration with RabbitMQ** for distributed task processing.
* **REST API** for remote generation management.
* Cloud **storage for templates and configurations**.
* Ability to **customize templates** for team-specific standards.

---

## 🧩 Technology Stack

* **Java 17+**
* **Spring Boot / Spring Cloud**
* **RabbitMQ** — asynchronous task queue
* **PostgreSQL** — configuration and metadata storage
* **Docker** — containerization and deployment
* **Gradle / Maven** — build tool support

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user sends a request with generation parameters (architecture type, build tool, dependencies, etc.).
2. The task is placed in a RabbitMQ queue.
3. JArch workers process the task and generate the project.
4. The result is stored in cloud storage and made available for download.
